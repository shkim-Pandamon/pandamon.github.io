Hi! This is Pandamon, living in South Korea.  

I am studying and working on `AI based Data Science` and `SW Development`. I majoring in `machine learning` from theory to practical usages, especially on `PHM(Prognostics and Health Management)` related with `rotating mechinery systems` and `human cardiovascular system`.

Welcome to my blog, and thanks for having an interest on me :)
